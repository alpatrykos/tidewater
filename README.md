# Tidewater

An island fishing game for the browser. Cast from the pier, the beach or your own boat, fight the fish,
sell your catch to Joe at the fish stand, and spend it on better gear at Marta's chandlery. Around it is a
real-time tropical island and ocean: swim the reef, drive the boat out to deep water, and watch a humpback
breach. It runs directly on WebGPU and WGSL with its own small rendering engine, no framework.

**Play it:** https://dgreenheck.github.io/tidewater/

## Requirements

- A browser with WebGPU: a recent Chrome, Edge or Safari.
- A capable GPU. It targets 60 fps at 2560×1267 on an Apple M5 Pro, with a separate mobile preset targeting 60 fps on recent flagship phones. Actual mobile performance
  depends on the device and browser; this target has not yet been verified on physical phones.
- The first load compiles several hundred shaders, which can take a minute or more. Later visits are
  faster because the browser caches them.

## Features

**Fishing**
- A spinning rod and reel that cast, reel and bend under load, with the bail, rotor and crank animated.
- Bites that depend on the water (shallows, pier, reef, bay, deep water), depth and time of day, across
  18 Caribbean species.
- A line-tension fight: keep the tension in the green band, ease off when the fish runs.
- A full-screen catch card with the fish's length and weight, a fish log with records, and a cooler.
- Joe's fish stand buys your catch; Marta's chandlery sells line, reels, rods, a bigger hold, fuel, a rebuilt
  engine, a fish finder and deck floodlights for night fishing.
- Walk the deck and the wheelhouse while the boat drifts; the boat burns fuel.
- Fly a single-seat open-frame helicopter from its pad on the beach: the mouse turns it, W A S D tilt the
  rotor, Space / C climb and descend, Shift flies fast. Land on the sand, the pier or the sea and press E to get out.
- A first-play guide, contextual tips and a minimap. Progress is saved in the browser.

**Ocean**
- Four-cascade FFT ocean (Tessendorf spectra) with foam, whitecaps, wind streaks and swell.
- Depth-aware breaking waves with peeling shoulders, whitewater, spray and foam lace.
- A shallow-water simulation for swash running up and down the sand.
- Boat wake and bow spray, and a whale wake.
- Caustics on the seabed and in the water, with light shafts.
- A split underwater/above-water view at the waterline, with water droplets on the lens after surfacing.
- Refraction of the seabed through the surface, including behind the pier and boats.

**Sky**
- Physically based atmosphere (Hillaire 2020) with a sun, moon and stars.
- Volumetric cumulus and wispy cirrus with cloud shadows on the land.
- Aerial perspective and sea haze.
- God rays, and a lens flare with occlusion.

**World**
- An island with a beach, hills, headlands and rocks.
- A fishing village, a pier, and the vendors' stalls built from Poly Haven scans.
- Realistic vendor characters (Microsoft Rocketbox) with skinned animation.
- A coral reef with fish.
- Palms, bananas, monstera, elephant ear, heliconia, bird of paradise, broadleaf trees, shrubs and dune
  grass, with impostors and dithered LOD fades.
- Beach debris.
- Birds, crabs and marine snow.
- Wild boars forage near the upper beach and inland vegetation, root in the soil, and trot away when approached. Detailed anatomy, groomed bristle coats, articulated steps, and small ear and head movements bring them to life up close.
- A humpback whale with an escort of fish, blows, fluke dives and breaches.

**Lighting and post**
- Cascaded shadows with contact-hardening penumbrae, and screen-space contact shadows.
- Ground bounce light.
- GTAO ambient occlusion.
- Temporal upscaling and sharpening.
- Bloom, auto exposure and motion blur.
- Night lighting from lanterns, windows and the boat, plus a flashlight that also works underwater.

**Audio**
- Positional audio from real CC0 field recordings: surf timed to each breaking wave, wind, birds, the boat
  engine, footsteps by surface, underwater ambience, whale song, and the rod and reel (casts, the bail,
  reeling, the drag, line snaps, splashes).

### Fishing

Walk the deck of the boat while it drifts, or fish from the pier and the beach. Cast, wait for the bobber
to dip and strike when it's pulled under, then play the fish: keep the line tension in the green band,
ease off when it runs. Different water holds different fish (the shallows, the pier, the reef, the bay and
deep water offshore), and some bite best at dawn, dusk or night. Sell your catch to Joe at the fish stand
on the beach by the pier, and spend it at Marta's chandlery by the boathouse: stronger line, a faster reel,
a longer rod, a bigger fish hold, a larger fuel tank, a rebuilt engine, a fish finder and deck floodlights for
night fishing. The boat burns diesel at the helm; fill up at the chandlery. Progress is saved in the browser.

The settings panel (H) exposes the sea state, time of day, sun azimuth, clouds, haze, post-processing and
more.

## Credits and license

The code is released under the MIT license; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Third-party assets (CC0 audio from
Freesound, CC0 scans from Poly Haven, MIT characters from Microsoft Rocketbox, OFL / Apache fonts) and
technique references are listed in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## Mobile rendering

The mobile preset keeps the island, FFT ocean, clouds, and gameplay. It starts at 70% internal
resolution with temporal upscaling, renders clouds at a further 65% scale, uses 1024² shadow maps
and a 384² shoreline simulation, and disables screen-space water reflections (sky reflections remain).
Desktop defaults are unchanged. The Performance panel shows the selected preset and lets you adjust
render scale and water reflections. Preset URL changes require a reload because simulation and shadow
resources are allocated during startup. Mobile resolution adapts gradually between 50% and the preset ceiling toward 60 FPS. Adjusting the
render-scale slider or providing `scale` in the URL selects manual resolution. The Performance panel
can re-enable adaptation. Mobile caustic texture and mesh dimensions are halved, refraction renders at
35% of internal resolution, and motion blur is off (its compute passes are skipped).

For device validation, compare `?quality=desktop&noAudio` and `?quality=mobile&noAudio` on the same
phone, browser, orientation, and camera path after shader compilation. Check the village, beach,
open ocean, and underwater views, then sustain the run for several minutes to check thermal slowdown.
A desktop browser at a phone-sized viewport does not establish phone performance.

### Touch controls

Touch controls appear on devices with a coarse primary pointer. Use `?touch` to force them for testing,
or `?touch=0` to hide them. Drag the left stick to walk, swim, or steer the boat; drag the scene to look.
Use Rod to equip, hold Cast and release to cast, tap Strike at a bite, and hold Reel during a fight.
Retrieve brings an empty line back. Interact boards the boat, uses the helm, and talks to vendors.
Jump / Up, Dive, Sprint, boat camera, Cooler, Light, and Settings have dedicated buttons.
Movement, looking, and fishing support separate simultaneous pointers. Menus, cancelled touches,
orientation changes, and focus loss clear held touch actions; interrupted windups do not cast.
